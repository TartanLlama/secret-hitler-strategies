## Basic Strategy
### Chancellor nomination
#### As a Liberal
Since you want to ensure the play of as many Liberal policies as possible, you should nominate the player you trust the most to be chancellor. If you have little trust for any other player, you might want to pick a chancellor who has not been on a government yet to gather information on as many players as possible. Be careful when nominating a chancellor after three Fascist policies have been played, as the Fascists will win the game if Hitler is successfully nominated. Note that if Hitler is playing well, they may be one of the most trusted players in the game. As such, you need to be on the lookout for strange votes which might point to Fascists pushing for a Hitler nomination.

#### As a Fascist
As a Fascist, you are one of the few players who has full knowledge of everyone's roles. However, you must be careful not to give away too much information with your nominations. At the early stages of the game when few governments have gone through it is often best to stay undercover. One option is to not take sides and pick chancellors that the group considers reasonable. Sometimes this will allow you to put two Fascists into a government, but don't worry too much if it doesn't happen.

After the placement of three Fascist policies you must be more aware of your nominations. At this stage watch out for Liberal players hunting for suspicious actions; if the other players are experienced then all it takes is one bad vote to give yourself and Hitler away. As a Fascist you must balance up your desire to nominate Hitler or a fellow Fascist with hiding your identity by putting through sub-optimal governments. All it takes to spoil trust gained for Hitler in the early stages of the game is for a Fascist to be too eager to get them nominated. You must also gauge the group's suspicion of you at this stage and you may instead try to shift it onto unsuspecting Liberals, perhaps by acting as if a Liberal is Hitler by nominating them or voting for them when it is seemingly illogical to do so.

#### As Hitler
When playing as Hitler, you should nominate in the same way as a Liberal. Since you do not have knowledge of the roles of other players in the game this should be easy. Do not worry about trying to find your fellow Fascists as they will often signal to you where possible. It is usually advantageous to build trustworthy governments, as this will allow you to push for yourself to be chancellor later.

If you have managed to work out the identity of your fellow Fascists it can be useful to have them on a government. This will allow you to collaborate to ensure Fascist policies go down. The only thing to watch out for here is whether they have suspicion on them already. If they do, this can often reflect on yourself and lead to distrust.

### Presidential Actions
The President has the most power in the Government because they get the first look at the cards and the possibility of activating a Fascist power. Other players will be aware of this, so your actions will be under scrutiny.

#### As a Liberal
When playing as a Liberal, your main choice when giving your cards to the Chancellor is whether you pass one or two Liberal cards when you draw 2L1F. Generally, passing two Liberals is only a good idea when the Liberals are behind near the end of the game; otherwise you can be denying the Liberal team of information on the Chancellor. Giving a choice to the Chancellor could result in a Fascist play, in which case you know the Chancellor is a Fascist.

If you draw one Liberal you could decide to discard it in order to gain a Fascist power. This only really makes sense for the investigation and assassination powers; the others are not powerful enough to give up a Liberal play for. This should be done judiciously and not when the Liberals are already behind on the scoreboard (unless you are fairly sure you can kill Hitler).

#### As a Fascist
Your main choice as a Fascist President is whether to discard Liberal policies or not. On a draw of 1L2F, discarding the Liberal and forcing a Fascist play brings your team closer to victory (and maybe gives you a Fascist power), but it will also cast suspicion upon you. You need to carefully consider the current state of the game to decide whether you can get away with discarding a Liberal, or if it's worth doing even if it'll likely out you as a Fascist. It is easier to sell a 0L3F draw if lots of Liberal policies have been played since the last shuffle, since there will be less Liberals in the deck and you can call on the power of statistics to save you. It can also be profitable to force a Fascist play if a few Liberal Presidents have had unlucky 0L3F draws, as you add chaos to the game.

If your Chancellor is also a Fascist, you could even play a Fascist policy on a draw of 2L1F. If you do this at the wrong time or aren't convincing enough, this could out both of you as Fascists and effectively lose you the game, but it is profitable when it works. By discarding two Liberals from the deck you make it much more likely for Liberal Presidents to draw 0L3F, thus covering up your lie somewhat. If you are going for this strategy, you should be sure to do it as soon as possible after a shuffle to get as much cover as you can. Of course, if the Fascist team is far behind, it may make sense to discard two Liberals just to give you a better chance of winning. As always, consider the trust of the table and state of the board.

### Chancellor action
Being the Chancellor can be a dangerous place to be, as you are somewhat at the whim of chance and the President. You can easily find yourself in a dispute, either from your own choice of from the lies of a Fascist President.

#### As a Liberal
Just play a Liberal policy if you get one. Playing a Fascist card on a choice to give the President a Fascist power is the only possible reason for not doing this, but that strategy is incredibly risky and may well cost you the game.

#### As a Fascist
Deciding whether or not to discard a Liberal policy when given a choice can be difficult. It will put you up on the scoreboard, but will almost certainly result in a dispute, which may cut you out of the game. Consider how much chaos is currently at the table, how important a Fascist policy play is, how much trust the President has, and what Fascist power the President would get when making your choice.

### Aftermath
After the card is revealed, it is usually useful to ask both players what cards they received and what they discarded. The players may not reveal this information, or they may lie, but it helps to get an idea of how many Fascists remain in the deck so that you can evaluate future governments.

#### As a Liberal
Telling the truth about what you saw is a good basic strategy for Liberals, as it ensures that the other Liberal players have the most information available to them when making decisions later on, and for evaluating the probability of a Fascist policy involving foul play.

#### As a Fascist
The aftermath is a key place for Fascists to inject chaos into the game. Telling the truth can gain you trust, but subtly changing the story can pay off later in the game. For example, if you draw 1L2F as a President and pass 1L1F to the Chancellor, it often makes sense to claim you drew 2L1F, as it will create the illusion that there are less Liberals in the deck then there actually are. This will make it easier for other Fascist players to justify Liberal policy discards until the cards are shuffled.

If you give a Liberal Chancellor 2F, then you need to decide whether to say you drew 3F, or that you gave the player a choice and they discarded a Liberal policy. This can be even more profitable if you say that you drew 2L1F, discarded a Liberal to give them a choice, and were then betrayed, as this creates chaos *and* increases Liberal discard viability. If you decide to lie and throw the player under the bus, you need to be able to sell it with your body language and reaction as well. This can only really be learned by trying it out and watching how experienced players act. Note that in a high player-count game you may find yourself cut out of the game if there isn't a lot of distrust already planted, so carefully consider whether the benefit is worth the soft elimination.

### Disputes
When there is a dispute as a result of a governmental action (e.g. investigator claims to have seen a Fascist but the investigatee claims to be a Liberal or president claims to have passed across a liberal and that the chancellor discarded) this means that there is guaranteed to be at least one fascist within the pair. If there is a dispute exclude both players from play where possible. This means do not elect them to government, do not investigate them, do not nominate as chancellors and do not assassinate. The reason for this is that there is too much risk following and trusting one.
