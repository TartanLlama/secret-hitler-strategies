# Secret Hitler Strategy

Introduction goes here.

## Strategy overview

### Liberals

If you are a Liberal, don’t say that you’re Fascist. Maybe you think it’ll make it easier for you to be nominated when you *are* Fascist, but don’t be surprised if Liberals refuse to vote for your governments when you’re Liberal.

Liberals never lie. Liberals should tell the truth and play liberal policies where possible as such when you play you should trust that your fellow liberal is not lying.

Exceptions: Liberals might lie. If a liberal receives two or more liberal policies as a president or chancellor they may lie and instead claim they only received one. The motivation for this is to deny the fascists information about how many liberals have been discarded, and makes them less likely to discard liberals because it’s harder to convince the rest of the table that they got three fascists.

Where possible you want to pass or play a liberal policy. As a President or Chancellor you will generally want to ensure that a liberal is played if you see one. As such, the default strategy is to simply pass one across or play one if you have been given it. This is a good all-round strategy that brings the liberals closer to victory.

When unsure about your Chancellor choice, voting against your own candidate can provide information through votes. Where possible have the next President (which you deem likely a Liberal) also vote for the same Chancellor. If unsure (Hitler has been enabled) get the next two Presidents to follow the tactic.

### Regular Fascists

Fascists generally want to sow as much dissent and chaos as possible. Confused liberals generally keeps the fascists in a strong position. However you must watch out that you do not trip up over your own lies.

It is often good as a fascist to play straightforward, logically and for the most part as a liberal. Doing so provides two key benefits. The first is a reasonable alibi “I’m a liberal and trying to be helpful! Why would I point out such a good plan if I was fascist?” if suspicion is pointed your way. The second comes if your cover becomes blown, this then can taint your good liberal logic and will cause others to look upon your recommendations with suspicion.

Feigning ignorance is often a good way to cover up your manipulative actions. As strategies are formulated and the meta evolves, it's often easiest to claim “Ah! I didn’t realise that was a thing!” to cover up something that you may have done that seems out of the ordinary.

Sometimes it works for fascists to create a double dispute. For example, when an investigation power to be opened,  fascist president forces chancellor to play a fascist policy and then claims, he gave a choice. When getting investigation power, investigate a liberal and claim he is a fascist. Since three people are in dispute, it is more difficult to exclude them from the game and players would be forced to take sides.

Playing liberal policies is often beneficial. It burns through liberal policies (especially if you can discard one or two while doing so), meaning it is more likely that liberal governments will be forced to enact fascist policies. This increases trust for you and simultaneous increases distrust for later (well-meaning liberal) governments.

## Game phases
### Setup
When examining your envelope, be sure to examine both your party membership and role cards **even if you are a liberal**. Everyone should look at both their cards otherwise you can tell who is a fascist by whoever looked at both their cards. By looking at both cards, the game starts fairly for both teams and this cannot be used against anyone throughout. This is also important for all liberals to do since if a liberal does look at both cards you may be inclined to judge them as fascist for doing so.

### Voting
We aim to make it the responsibility of the current President to call the vote. This allows the President to begin the countdown after the Chancellor has been selected.

Sometimes conversations and discussions occur during and after selection is made but before the vote is called. This is generally allowed but it is important that the President ensures everyone knows who is nominated for Chancellor. Occasionally we have had games where a vote is called before everyone knows who the nominee is or a vote is called unclearly resulting in a late vote.

Vote at the same time as everyone else. The president should count down from five, at which point everyone should flip their cards at the same time.

The recommended way to vote is to decide in advance who you wish to vote for, take the appropriate card out (yes or no) and enqueue it, keeping it out, clearly in front of you and ready for flipping. This way others can see that you are ready to vote and also that you have not switched/made a decision based on any other visible cards.

It is inconsiderate to vote late as you may see others votes and be influenced by this. As a house rule your group may decide that late votes automatically count as “nein” votes.

It is also recommended that you do not leave votes lying out even if your intention is to vote that way.

#### Maximising Presidency
If you are a possible choice for President (i.e. within two clockwise spaces of the initial president since the vote count reset), then it can often make sense to vote down governments to maximise your chance of getting the Presidency and therefore having more of an influence over the game. This is particularly important if a strong power will activated if a Fascist policy is enacted. This is a general strategy that applies to both teams as you can trust yourself more than the others to make the right decision.

An exception to this rule is that Hitler may avoid becoming President. This can be for multiple reasons including allowing themselves to become Chancellor for victory in the future, they might not trust themselves with the assassination or they might prefer other players use the investigation.

### Presidential Actions
#### As a Liberal
When playing as a Liberal, your main choice when giving your cards to the Chancellor is whether you pass one or two Liberal cards when you draw 2L1F. Generally, passing two Liberals is a good idea when the Liberals are behind near the end of the game; otherwise you can be denying the Liberal team of information on the Chancellor. Giving a choice to the Chancellor could result in a Fascist play, in which case you know the Chancellor is a Fascist.

If you draw one Liberal you could decide to discard it in order to gain a Fascist power. This only really makes sense for the investigation and assassination powers; the others are not powerful enough to give up a Liberal play for. This should be done judiciously and not when the Liberals are already behind on the scoreboard (unless you are fairly sure you can kill Hitler).

### Aftermath
After the card is revealed, it is usually useful to ask both players what cards they received and what they discarded. The players may not reveal this information, or they may lie, but it helps to get an idea of how many Fascists remain in the deck so that you can evaluate future governments.

#### As a Liberal President
If the Chancellor plays a Liberal, then all is (mostly) well. If a Fascist is played, however, you have a choice to make. You could inform the table immediately that the Chancellor discarded a Liberal and is therefore Fascist; this will put you in dispute with the Chancellor and could result in a soft-elimination depending on the number of players and established meta. For the most part this is a good strategy, as the Liberals have the majority taking down a Fascist this way still maintains the Liberal majority. Alternatively you can keep the information to yourself until it becomes necessary to reveal it. This will put pressure on the Chancellor as they will be waiting for you to reveal their betrayal so that they can best counter your accusation. They may out themselves by reacting to your lack of reaction, or by making other mistakes due to them being on-edge.

Regardless of the action you took, you need to decide whether or not to reveal what cards you drew and what you discarded. Generally, honesty as a Liberal is the best policy. However, if you draw more than one Liberal, it can make sense to lie and say that you only received one. This will create the illusion that there are more Liberals in the deck then there actually are, so the Fascists will be less likely to discard one for fear of being discovered. However, you should probably reveal this information when the deck is to be shuffled so that the plays can be correctly analysed by your fellow Liberals.

## Fascist track powers
When a Fascist policy is played, the President may get a special power to enact. These powers are can make or break the game, so a lot of attention should be payed to when the powers will be used, who will use them, and who you suspect they will use them on.

### Investigations
When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Liberal, the probability of the investigatee being Liberal is slightly higher. The four possibilities are:

- Liberal President, Liberal Chancellor: Should always result in a liberal call
- FL: The Fascist President may accuse the Chancellor in order to create chaos, or they might call a Liberal to maintain cover
- LF: Should always result in a fascist call
- FF: Most of the time the president will call liberal, but they might sometimes call fascist to cause chaos.

When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Fascist, the probability of the investigator being Hitler is low. This is due to the fact that Hitler generally wouldn’t want to create a dispute and bring attention to themselves. Due to our current strategy of soft-eliminating those in a dispute if Hitler was to create a dispute this would prevent a Hitler nomination victory.

The investigation is almost always more useful than it is a hindrance. **Do not Brexit and lose the power**.

Chain investigations in 9/10 player games are almost always a bad idea. They limit the amount of information you can get and can cause chaos late in the game if you draw incorrect conclusions from them. They are also difficult to trust, because at least two members of the chain will have been fascist-playing presidents, since that’s how one gets the investigation power.

### Executions
#### As a Liberal
If you are not, then you need to be careful not to give the Fascists an even player count to the Liberals so that they can’t mass downvote good governments. This is particularly important in games with an odd number of players, where killing a liberal by accident will make it hard for the liberals to win the game. It can often be safer to kill someone you *know* is Fascist rather than fishing for Hitler and killing a liberal by accident; particularly because Hitler will often be playing as a Liberal.

It is difficult to identify Hitler over the course of the game. If you have suspicion of someone for being Hitler you should be sure before assassinating as Hitler could be disguised as the most Liberal player instead.

For identifying Hitler for assassination, semi-valid reasons for assassinations can include but are not limited to the following:

- This section is still to be completed.


Support from particular players at odd times in the game for no particular reason. As fascists have extra knowledge, they may accidentally side with Hitler early on with no justifiable reason.

If you don’t know any Fascists, a more risky option is to kill the person you trust least from a dispute. The second assassination power can then be used to kill the other member of the dispute. This ensures that you have killed *at least* one Fascist, and therefore you haven’t unbalanced the voting. Of course, if you pick wrong on the first kill in an odd-player game then you could be in trouble, but it’s still possible to get back in control if Hitler doesn’t know who the other Fascists are.

### Choose president
This section is still to be completed.

### Look at top three cards
This power is only available in 5/6 player games, but the version which is present in the rules is not particularly interesting for us. The problem is that if a Liberal looks at the top cards and says that there are Liberal policies at the top, then the Liberals can choose to just Brexit to get free Liberal plays. If a Fascist gets the power and lies, then it’s easy for them to be outed. This can be addressed somewhat by either making the examiner shuffle the three cards before they put them back on top, or (our favourite) barring them from communicating what the cards were before all three have been played or discarded.


-----------------------

## General Observations
### Disputes
When there is a dispute as a result of a governmental action (e.g. investigator claims to have seen a fascist but the investigatee claims to be a liberal or president claims to have passed across a liberal and that the chancellor discarded) this means that there is guaranteed to be at least one fascist within the pair. If there is a dispute exclude both players from play where possible. This means do not elect them to government, do not investigate them, do not nominate as chancellors and do not assassinate. The reason for this is that there is too much risk following and trusting one.

### Card Counting
There are 17 cards in total: 6 liberal and 11 fascists.

In the first round of governments there can be 5 functional governments before the deck needs to be shuffled (3 cards x 5 = 15). As such, in the first round you will see 15 cards as a group but the remaining two will be unknown as they get shuffled back in. For the second round after the deck is shuffled there should now be 12 cards in the deck. In round two you have the possibility of 4 governments which will then see all the cards If you get to the end of the second deck and the game isn’t over there will only be one more government after the shuffle.

Causing a failed government three times (also known as Brexit or breakfast) will disrupt this order. In round 1 if you vote past the governments twice you can see all the cards. In round 2 the failed vote will result in more cards being hidden.

---------------------

### Crazy stuff

#### The Flip-Flop
Early voting can be unproportionally counted on compared to other votes. In the first round of voting, Fascists have the advantage and it is likely that liberals will vote against, wasting a potential government. Flip-flopping between games can help mitigate this due to balancing skeptical Liberals to optimistic ones. WARNING: This has a side effect of unpredictable player meta; players may see you as untrustworthy because they cannot reason about your initial vote - especially if you were next in line to be President.

Liberal investigating a fascist, claims they are a liberal, sits on that information for a while and then revealing that person is a fascist later.

Liberal President force their Chancellor to play a fascist to receive the investigation power (only available in 6+ player games) to investigate their Chancellor. An extension to this play happens when the Liberal President find their Chancellor is a Fascist but informs the other players that they are Liberal. The reaction the Fascist Chancellor may reveal if the Chancellor is a Fascist or Hitler. Hitler would may react to the move, whereas a Fascist may be startled by answer.

Claiming to have accidentally played the wrong (i.e., fascist) policy.

Being Liberal president, discarding liberals and forcing chancellor to play fascist to get power.

## Glossary
Brexit - Voting down three governments in a row, thus causing a policy to be revealed at random. So-called because some players would vote “no” in order to register dissent, assuming that everyone else would vote yes, but if too many people do this, then the government will actually fail.

Breakfast - Another name for Brexit

Chain investigation - The second investigator in a 9/10 player game investigating the first investigator.

Cut out - Someone who is still alive, but is no longer considered for Governments by the table due to them being in a dispute.
