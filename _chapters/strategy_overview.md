## Strategy overview

### Liberals

As a Liberal your aim is to ensure that Liberal policies are enacted and to discover Fascists in order to execute or soft-eliminate them.

Liberals should tell the truth about what they see, play, and discard. This is useful so that the Liberals have the maximum amount of information available to them when making decisions. If a Liberal is caught lying about something, it can seriously undermine their trust and make it easier for Fascists to infiltrate the Liberal block.

Where possible you want to pass or play Liberal policies. As a President or Chancellor you will want to ensure that a Liberal is played if you see one. As such, the default strategy is to simply pass one across or play one if you have been given it. This is a good all-round strategy that brings the liberals closer to victory.

If you are a Liberal, don’t say that you’re Fascist. Some players do this to make it easier for you to be nominated when they *are* Fascist, but it just makes other players less likely to vote for their governments. If you do this as a Liberal, you are just harming your team.

### Regular Fascists

Fascists want to sow as much dissent and chaos as possible, giving confused Liberals a path to bring about their own demise. However you must watch out that you do not trip up over your own lies.

Most of the time Fascists should pretend they are Liberals, only furthering the Fascist agenda when they have plausible deniability. A player who does this well will be able to curry favour with the Liberals, allowing them to subtly continue with their deceit, biding their time for a merciless betrayal when it counts the most.

Fascists should also do their best to help Hitler gain trust so that they can be elected chancellor and win the game. This usually involves allowing them to play Liberal policies and attempting to eliminate other players from the game to clear the way. But be careful not to support Hitler *too* much, or the Liberal players might catch on!

### Hitler

Hitler has the most sensitive role, as they can bring about an early victory or defeat for the Fascists. A good Hitler player can worm their way into the Liberal block and get themselves nominated while still playing Fascist cards when they think they can get away with it. A poor one may get discovered and make themselves a prime target for execution powers, undermining any results the other Fascists have been achieving.

The most basic Hitler strategy is to just play as a straight Liberal. Try to make all the same decisions you would make as a Liberal player; playing Liberal policies, discovering Fascists, voting conservatively. If you can do this well, you should have a reasonable amount of trust from the Liberal players to get you voted in as chancellor when it matters. Of course, with this strategy you are relying on the regular Fascists to enact the policies you need to win the game, but a straight Liberal Hitler play is a good idea if you aren't comfortable trying more advanced tactics.

When you are more familiar with the game, you can try selectively discarding Liberal policies when you can plausibly deny doing so. However, try not to get in disputes with other players, as you could quickly find yourself cut out of the game with no chance of being elected for that early victory.
