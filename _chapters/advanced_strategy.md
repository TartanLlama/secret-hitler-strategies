### Double dispute
Sometimes it works for Fascists to create a double dispute. For example, if an investigation is coming up and the President is Fascist:

1. The President forces the Chancellor to play a Fascist policy and then claims that they were given a choice.
2. The President investigates a Liberal and claims that they are Fascist.

Since three people are in dispute, it is more difficult to exclude them from the game and players would be forced to take sides.

### Self-downvoting
When unsure about your Chancellor choice, voting against your own candidate can provide information through the other player's votes. Where possible, have the next President (who you deem likely a Liberal) also vote for the same Chancellor. If unsure (Hitler has been enabled) get the next two Presidents to follow the tactic.

### Maximising Presidency
If you are a possible choice for President (i.e. within two clockwise spaces of the initial president since the vote count reset), then it can often make sense to vote down governments to maximise your chance of getting the Presidency and therefore having more of an influence over the game. This is particularly important if a strong power will activated if a Fascist policy is enacted. This is a general strategy that applies to both teams as you can trust yourself more than the others to make the right decision.

An exception to this rule is that Hitler may avoid becoming President. This can be for multiple reasons including allowing themselves to become Chancellor for victory in the future, they might not trust themselves with the assassination or they might prefer other players use the investigation.

### Reveal trickery
#### As a Liberal president
If the Chancellor plays a Liberal, then all is (mostly) well. If a Fascist is played, however, you have a choice to make. You could inform the table immediately that the Chancellor discarded a Liberal and is therefore Fascist; this will put you in dispute with the Chancellor and could result in a soft-elimination depending on the number of players and established meta. For the most part this is a good strategy, as the Liberals can be certain that they have cut out at least one Fascist. Alternatively you can keep the information to yourself until it becomes necessary to reveal it. This will put pressure on the Chancellor as they will be waiting for you to reveal their betrayal so that they can best counter your accusation. They may out themselves by reacting to your lack of reaction, or by making other mistakes due to them being on-edge.

Regardless of the action you took, you need to decide whether or not to reveal what cards you drew and what you discarded. Generally, honesty as a Liberal is the best policy. However, if you draw more than one Liberal, it can make sense to lie and say that you only received one. This will create the illusion that there are more Liberals in the deck then there actually are, so the Fascists will be less likely to discard one for fear of being discovered. However, you should probably reveal this information when the deck is to be shuffled so that the plays can be correctly analysed by your fellow Liberals.

### Card Counting
There are 17 cards in total: 6 Liberal and 11 Fascists.

In the first round of governments there can be 5 functional governments before the deck needs to be shuffled (3 cards x 5 = 15). As such, in the first round you will see 15 cards as a group but the remaining two will be unknown as they get shuffled back in. For the second round after the deck is shuffled there should now be 12 cards in the deck. In round two you have the possibility of 4 governments which will then see all the cards If you get to the end of the second deck and the game isnâ€™t over there will only be one more government after the shuffle.

Causing a failed government three times (also known as Brexit or breakfast) will disrupt this order. In round 1 if you vote past the governments twice you can see all the cards. In round 2 the failed vote will result in more cards being hidden.
