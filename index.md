# The Unofficial Secret Hitler Strategy Guide

### WORK IN PROGRESS

[Secret Hitler](http://secrethitler.com/) is a social deduction game for 5–10 people about finding and stopping the Secret Hitler.

The majority of players are liberals. If they can learn to trust each other, they have enough votes to control the table and win the game. But some players are fascists. They will say whatever it takes to get elected, enact their agenda, and blame others for the fallout. The liberals must work together to discover the truth before the fascists install their cold-blooded leader and win the game.

This is an unofficial strategy guide for Secret Hitler. We wrote it to immortalise the insight gained from our group's 400+ games in the form of a living document. We will continue to update this guide as we butcher our metagame and reassemble it into some horrifying meta-Frankenstein's monster.

If you have suggestions for additions or improvements to this guide, please submit an issue or pull request to the repository [here](https://github.com/TartanLlama/secret-hitler-strategies).

## Strategy overview

### Liberals

As a Liberal your aim is to ensure that Liberal policies are enacted and to discover fascists in order to execute or soft-eliminate them.

Liberals should tell the truth about what they see, play, and discard. This is useful so that the Liberals have the maximum amount of information available to them when making decisions. If a Liberal is caught lying about something, it can seriously undermine their trust and make it easier for Fascists to infiltrate the Liberal block.

Where possible you want to pass or play Liberal policies. As a President or Chancellor you will want to ensure that a Liberal is played if you see one. As such, the default strategy is to simply pass one across or play one if you have been given it. This is a good all-round strategy that brings the liberals closer to victory.

If you are a Liberal, don’t say that you’re Fascist. Some players do this to make it easier for you to be nominated when they *are* Fascist, but it just makes other players less likely to vote for their governments. If you do this as a Liberal, you are just harming your team.

### Regular Fascists

Fascists generally want to sow as much dissent and chaos as possible. Confused liberals generally keeps the fascists in a strong position. However you must watch out that you do not trip up over your own lies.

It is often good as a fascist to play straightforward, logically and for the most part as a liberal. Doing so provides two key benefits. The first is a reasonable alibi “I’m a liberal and trying to be helpful! Why would I point out such a good plan if I was fascist?” if suspicion is pointed your way. The second comes if your cover becomes blown, this then can taint your good liberal logic and will cause others to look upon your recommendations with suspicion.

Feigning ignorance is often a good way to cover up your manipulative actions. As strategies are formulated and the meta evolves, it's often easiest to claim “Ah! I didn’t realise that was a thing!” to cover up something that you may have done that seems out of the ordinary.


### Hitler

Hitler has the most sensitive role, as they can easily win or lose the game for the Fascists. A good Hitler player can worm their way into the Liberal block and get themselves nominated while still playing Fascist cards when they think they can get away with it. A poor one may get discovered and make themselves a prime target for execution powers, undermining any results the other Fascists have been achieving.

The most basic Hitler strategy is to just play as a straight liberal. Try to make all the same decisions you would make as a Liberal player; playing Liberal policies, discovering Fascists, voting conservatively. If you can do this well, you should have a reasonable amount of trust from the Liberal players to get you voted in as chancellor when it matters. Of course, with this strategy you are relying on the regular Fascists to enact the policies you need to win the game, but a straight Liberal Hitler play is a good idea if you aren't comfortable trying more advanced tactics.

When you are more familiar with the game, you can try selectively discarding Liberal policies when you can plausibly deny doing so. However, try not to get in disputes with other players, as you could quickly find yourself cut out of the game with no chance of being elected for that early victory.

--------------

## Basic Strategy
### Chancellor nomination
#### As a Liberal
Since you want to ensure the play of as many Liberal policies as possible, you should nominate the player you trust the most to be chancellor. If you have little trust for any other player, you might want to pick a chancellor who has not been on a government yet to gather information on as many players as possible. Be careful when nominating a chancellor after three Fascist policies have been played, as the Fascists will win the game if Hitler is succesfully nominated. Note that if Hitler is playing well, they may be one of the most trusted players in the game. As such, you need to be on the lookout for strange votes which might point to Fascists pushing for a Hitler nomination.

#### As a Fascist
As a Fascist, you are one of the few players who has full knowledge of everyone's roles. However, you must be careful not to give too much information with your nominations. At the early stages of the game when few governments have gone through it is often best to stay undercover. One option is to not take sides and pick chancellors that the group considers reasonable. Sometimes this will allow you to put two Fascists into a government but don't worry too much if it doesn't happen. 

After the placement of three Fascist policies you must be more aware of your nominations. At this stage watch out for Liberal players hunting for suspicious nominations. As a Fascist you must balance up your desire to nominate Hitler or a fellow Fascist with putting through a sub-optimal government. All it takes to spoil trust gained for Hitler in the early stages of the game is for a Fascist to be too eager to approve it. You must also gauge your own suspicion within the group at this stage. If some people are suspicious of you and you can instead try to cast suspicion on innocent Liberals. Bearing in mind what may make nominating Hitler suspicious you can do the same on a Liberal.

#### As Hitler
When playing as Hitler, you should nominate in the same way as a Liberal. Since you do not have knowledge of the roles of other players in the game this should be easy. Do not worry about trying to find your fellow Fascists as they will often signal to you where possible. Often you will want to build trustworthy governments. This will then allow you to push for yourself to be chancellor later.

If you have managed to work out the identity of your fellow Fascists it can be useful to have them on a government. This will allow you to collaborate to ensure Fascist policies go down. The only thing to watch out for here is whether they have suspicion on them already. If they do, this can often reflect on yourself and lead to distrust.

### Presidential Actions
#### As a Liberal
When playing as a Liberal, your main choice when giving your cards to the Chancellor is whether you pass one or two Liberal cards when you draw 2L1F. Generally, passing two Liberals is a good idea when the Liberals are behind near the end of the game; otherwise you can be denying the Liberal team of information on the Chancellor. Giving a choice to the Chancellor could result in a Fascist play, in which case you know the Chancellor is a Fascist.

If you draw one Liberal you could decide to discard it in order to gain a Fascist power. This only really makes sense for the investigation and assassination powers; the others are not powerful enough to give up a Liberal play for. This should be done judiciously and not when the Liberals are already behind on the scoreboard (unless you are fairly sure you can kill Hitler).

### Aftermath
After the card is revealed, it is usually useful to ask both players what cards they received and what they discarded. The players may not reveal this information, or they may lie, but it helps to get an idea of how many Fascists remain in the deck so that you can evaluate future governments.

### Disputes
When there is a dispute as a result of a governmental action (e.g. investigator claims to have seen a fascist but the investigatee claims to be a liberal or president claims to have passed across a liberal and that the chancellor discarded) this means that there is guaranteed to be at least one fascist within the pair. If there is a dispute exclude both players from play where possible. This means do not elect them to government, do not investigate them, do not nominate as chancellors and do not assassinate. The reason for this is that there is too much risk following and trusting one.


-----------------

## Advanced Strategy

### Double dispute
Sometimes it works for fascists to create a double dispute. For example, when an investigation power to be opened,  fascist president forces chancellor to play a fascist policy and then claims, he gave a choice. When getting investigation power, investigate a liberal and claim he is a fascist. Since three people are in dispute, it is more difficult to exclude them from the game and players would be forced to take sides.


### Self-downvoting
When unsure about your Chancellor choice, voting against your own candidate can provide information through votes. Where possible have the next President (which you deem likely a Liberal) also vote for the same Chancellor. If unsure (Hitler has been enabled) get the next two Presidents to follow the tactic.


### Maximising Presidency
If you are a possible choice for President (i.e. within two clockwise spaces of the initial president since the vote count reset), then it can often make sense to vote down governments to maximise your chance of getting the Presidency and therefore having more of an influence over the game. This is particularly important if a strong power will activated if a Fascist policy is enacted. This is a general strategy that applies to both teams as you can trust yourself more than the others to make the right decision.

An exception to this rule is that Hitler may avoid becoming President. This can be for multiple reasons including allowing themselves to become Chancellor for victory in the future, they might not trust themselves with the assassination or they might prefer other players use the investigation.

### Reveal trickery
#### As a liberal president
If the Chancellor plays a Liberal, then all is (mostly) well. If a Fascist is played, however, you have a choice to make. You could inform the table immediately that the Chancellor discarded a Liberal and is therefore Fascist; this will put you in dispute with the Chancellor and could result in a soft-elimination depending on the number of players and established meta. For the most part this is a good strategy, as the Liberals have the majority taking down a Fascist this way still maintains the Liberal majority. Alternatively you can keep the information to yourself until it becomes necessary to reveal it. This will put pressure on the Chancellor as they will be waiting for you to reveal their betrayal so that they can best counter your accusation. They may out themselves by reacting to your lack of reaction, or by making other mistakes due to them being on-edge.

Regardless of the action you took, you need to decide whether or not to reveal what cards you drew and what you discarded. Generally, honesty as a Liberal is the best policy. However, if you draw more than one Liberal, it can make sense to lie and say that you only received one. This will create the illusion that there are more Liberals in the deck then there actually are, so the Fascists will be less likely to discard one for fear of being discovered. However, you should probably reveal this information when the deck is to be shuffled so that the plays can be correctly analysed by your fellow Liberals.

### Card Counting
There are 17 cards in total: 6 liberal and 11 fascists.

In the first round of governments there can be 5 functional governments before the deck needs to be shuffled (3 cards x 5 = 15). As such, in the first round you will see 15 cards as a group but the remaining two will be unknown as they get shuffled back in. For the second round after the deck is shuffled there should now be 12 cards in the deck. In round two you have the possibility of 4 governments which will then see all the cards If you get to the end of the second deck and the game isn’t over there will only be one more government after the shuffle.

Causing a failed government three times (also known as Brexit or breakfast) will disrupt this order. In round 1 if you vote past the governments twice you can see all the cards. In round 2 the failed vote will result in more cards being hidden.

-----------------

## Fascist track powers
When a Fascist policy is played, the President may get a special power to enact. These powers are can make or break the game, so a lot of attention should be payed to when the powers will be used, who will use them, and who you suspect they will use them on.

### Investigations
When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Liberal, the probability of the investigatee being Liberal is slightly higher. The four possibilities are:

- Liberal President, Liberal Chancellor: Should always result in a liberal call
- FL: The Fascist President may accuse the Chancellor in order to create chaos, or they might call a Liberal to maintain cover
- LF: Should always result in a fascist call
- FF: Most of the time the president will call liberal, but they might sometimes call fascist to cause chaos.

When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Fascist, the probability of the investigator being Hitler is low. This is due to the fact that Hitler generally wouldn’t want to create a dispute and bring attention to themselves. Due to our current strategy of soft-eliminating those in a dispute if Hitler was to create a dispute this would prevent a Hitler nomination victory.

The investigation is almost always more useful than it is a hindrance. **Do not Brexit and lose the power**.

Chain investigations in 9/10 player games are almost always a bad idea. They limit the amount of information you can get and can cause chaos late in the game if you draw incorrect conclusions from them. They are also difficult to trust, because at least two members of the chain will have been fascist-playing presidents, since that’s how one gets the investigation power.

### Executions
#### As a Liberal
If you are not, then you need to be careful not to give the Fascists an even player count to the Liberals so that they can’t mass downvote good governments. This is particularly important in games with an odd number of players, where killing a liberal by accident will make it hard for the liberals to win the game. It can often be safer to kill someone you *know* is Fascist rather than fishing for Hitler and killing a liberal by accident; particularly because Hitler will often be playing as a Liberal.

It is difficult to identify Hitler over the course of the game. If you have suspicion of someone for being Hitler you should be sure before assassinating as Hitler could be disguised as the most Liberal player instead.

For identifying Hitler for assassination, semi-valid reasons for assassinations can include but are not limited to the following:

- This section is still to be completed.


Support from particular players at odd times in the game for no particular reason. As fascists have extra knowledge, they may accidentally side with Hitler early on with no justifiable reason.

If you don’t know any Fascists, a more risky option is to kill the person you trust least from a dispute. The second assassination power can then be used to kill the other member of the dispute. This ensures that you have killed *at least* one Fascist, and therefore you haven’t unbalanced the voting. Of course, if you pick wrong on the first kill in an odd-player game then you could be in trouble, but it’s still possible to get back in control if Hitler doesn’t know who the other Fascists are.

#### As a Fascist
Ideally you want to kill a Liberal if you get the execution power as a Fascist. This lowers the voting power of the Liberals and can even up the player counts in a game with an odd number of players. As the Liberal's voting power gets lower, the Fascists will have an easier time electing Fascist governments and Hitler.

You need to consider whether or not you can justify killing a Liberal player to the others. If you can, then it's safe to kill them. If not, you need to decide whether it's more valuable to your team to kill an obvious Fascist to maintain trust, or to kill a Liberal and out yourself to the table. The latter can be a good choice if it will even the team counts, or if there is a strong Liberal block which can be disrupted. For example, if there are three Liberals who trust each other and keep cycling the governments between them, you could execute one so that the Liberals are forced to put trust in someone else -- maybe Hitler.

### Choose president
This section is still to be completed.

### Look at top three cards
This power is only available in 5/6 player games, but the version which is present in the rules is not particularly interesting for us. The problem is that if a Liberal looks at the top cards and says that there are Liberal policies at the top, then the Liberals can choose to just Brexit to get free Liberal plays. If a Fascist gets the power and lies, then it’s easy for them to be outed. This can be addressed somewhat by either making the examiner shuffle the three cards before they put them back on top, or (our favourite) barring them from communicating what the cards were before all three have been played or discarded.

-----------------------

## Experimental strategy

### The Flip-Flop
Early voting can be unproportionally counted on compared to other votes. In the first round of voting, Fascists have the advantage and it is likely that liberals will vote against, wasting a potential government. Flip-flopping between games can help mitigate this due to balancing skeptical Liberals to optimistic ones. WARNING: This has a side effect of unpredictable player meta; players may see you as untrustworthy because they cannot reason about your initial vote - especially if you were next in line to be President.

Liberal investigating a fascist, claims they are a liberal, sits on that information for a while and then revealing that person is a fascist later.

Liberal President force their Chancellor to play a fascist to receive the investigation power (only available in 6+ player games) to investigate their Chancellor. An extension to this play happens when the Liberal President find their Chancellor is a Fascist but informs the other players that they are Liberal. The reaction the Fascist Chancellor may reveal if the Chancellor is a Fascist or Hitler. Hitler would may react to the move, whereas a Fascist may be startled by answer.

Claiming to have accidentally played the wrong (i.e., fascist) policy.

Being Liberal president, discarding liberals and forcing chancellor to play fascist to get power.

-----------------

## Etiquette

### Setup
When examining your envelope, be sure to examine both your party membership and role cards **even if you are a liberal**. Everyone should look at both their cards otherwise you can tell who is a fascist by whoever looked at both their cards. By looking at both cards, the game starts fairly for both teams and this cannot be used against anyone throughout. This is also important for all liberals to do since if a liberal does look at both cards you may be inclined to judge them as fascist for doing so.

### Voting
We aim to make it the responsibility of the current President to call the vote. This allows the President to begin the countdown after the Chancellor has been selected.

Sometimes conversations and discussions occur during and after selection is made but before the vote is called. This is generally allowed but it is important that the President ensures everyone knows who is nominated for Chancellor. Occasionally we have had games where a vote is called before everyone knows who the nominee is or a vote is called unclearly resulting in a late vote.

Vote at the same time as everyone else. The president should count down from five, at which point everyone should flip their cards at the same time.

The recommended way to vote is to decide in advance who you wish to vote for, take the appropriate card out (yes or no) and enqueue it, keeping it out, clearly in front of you and ready for flipping. This way others can see that you are ready to vote and also that you have not switched/made a decision based on any other visible cards.

It is inconsiderate to vote late as you may see others votes and be influenced by this. As a house rule your group may decide that late votes automatically count as “nein” votes.

It is also recommended that you do not leave votes lying out even if your intention is to vote that way.

## Glossary

Brexit - Voting down three governments in a row, thus causing a policy to be revealed at random. So-called because some players would vote “no” in order to register dissent, assuming that everyone else would vote yes, but if too many people do this, then the government will actually fail.

Breakfast - Another name for Brexit

Chain investigation - The second investigator in a 9/10 player game investigating the first investigator.

Cut out - Someone who is still alive, but is no longer considered for Governments by the table due to them being in a dispute.

Liberal block/corner - A perceived group of Liberal players who are trusted by the majority.

Soft elimination - When a player is cut out.

Maverick cop - Someone who throws out unsubstantiated claims and their belief cannot be shaken.

Wheelbarrow - Someone who is doing something so crazy they should be carted off.
