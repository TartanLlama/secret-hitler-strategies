## Fascist track powers
When a Fascist policy is played, the President may get a special power to enact. These powers are can make or break the game, so a lot of attention should be payed to when the powers will be used, who will use them, and who you suspect they will use them on.

### Investigations
When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Liberal, the probability of the investigatee being Liberal is slightly higher. The four possibilities are:

- Liberal President, Liberal Chancellor: Should always result in a liberal call
- FL: The Fascist President may accuse the Chancellor in order to create chaos, or they might call a Liberal to maintain cover
- LF: Should always result in a fascist call
  - See the [Experimental Strategy: The Slow Burn](#the-slow-burn)
- FF: Most of the time the president will call liberal, but they might sometimes call fascist to cause chaos.

When there is an investigation and the investigatee is called to be a Fascist, the probability of the investigator being Hitler is low. This is due to the fact that Hitler generally wouldn’t want to create a dispute and bring attention to themselves. Due to our current strategy of soft-eliminating those in a dispute if Hitler was to create a dispute this would prevent a Hitler nomination victory.

The investigation is almost always more useful than it is a hindrance. **Do not Brexit and lose the power**.

Chain investigations in 9/10 player games are almost always a bad idea. They limit the amount of information you can get and can cause chaos late in the game if you draw incorrect conclusions from them. They are also difficult to trust, because at least two members of the chain will have been Fascist-playing presidents, since that’s how one gets the investigation power. You should keep this in mind when nominating presidents; if a player has been investigated and called a Liberal, you should **not** vote for them as president until the second investigation power has been used. If that player is nominated and happens to draw three Fascist policies (or pretends to), then the table will have inadvertently caused a chain investigation.

### Executions
#### As a Liberal
You must be careful when you have gained the power of Assassination. The Liberals only have a narrow majority, so you must make sure you do not shoot one of your teammates. There are two real choices to make as a Liberal with the Assassination power: shoot a known Fascist or try to shoot Hitler.

There are only two ways to know for sure if someone is fascist:
* Investigation
* Be in direct dispute over a policy

It is often safest to shoot whoever you are in a dispute with as a result of investigations or policy disputes. They are less likely to be Hitler, so other Liberals may question your choice, but increasing the Liberal majority is worthwhile. The alternative is to go after Hitler instead, the hard part is identifying them. Some reasons to suspect someone of being Hitler are:
* Support from suspicious players with no prior justification.
* As Fascists have extra knowledge, they may side with Hitler early on in an attempt to help them build trust.

If you don’t know any Fascists, a more risky option is to kill the person you trust least from a dispute. As you know there is a guaranteed Fascist between them it is only a *50/50* chance of killing the wrong person. In the worst case you can use the second assassination power to kill the other member of the dispute. This ensures that you have killed *at least* one Fascist, and thus haven’t unbalanced the voting. If you pick wrong with the first kill or if you do not have a second assassination this can lead to issues. It’s still possible to get back in control if Hitler doesn’t know who the other Fascists are.

#### As a Fascist
Ideally you want to kill a Liberal if you get the execution power as a Fascist. This lowers the voting power of the Liberals and can even up the player counts in a game with an odd number of players. As the Liberal's voting power gets lower, the Fascists will have an easier time electing Fascist governments and Hitler.

You need to consider whether or not you can justify killing a Liberal player to the others. If you can, then it's safe to kill them. If not, you need to decide whether it's more valuable to your team to kill an obvious Fascist to maintain trust, or to kill a Liberal and out yourself to the table. The latter can be a good choice if it will even the team counts, or if there is a strong Liberal block which can be disrupted. For example, if there are three Liberals who trust each other and keep cycling the governments between them, you could execute one so that the Liberals are forced to put trust in someone else -- maybe Hitler.

### Choose president
Choosing the next President can appear to be unimportant, but it can be the difference between an early Hitler nomination and a Liberal victory.

#### As a Liberal
If you have activated this power then Hitler can now be nominated for a Fascist victory. You might think that the obvious choice is to give the Presidency to the player you trust the most. The problem with that is the President then needs to choose a Chancellor who is not Hitler. As such, it will often make more sense to choose a President who is not quite as trusted so that the trusted player is eligible to be nominated as the Chancellor. Another interesting strategy is to select the players one or two spaces clockwise. This player will then have two chances at electing a successful Government, so the first choice can be used as a trial to look for strange votes or reactions, then the second choice can be voted through if it seems sound.

#### As a Fascist
A Fascist player should usually go along with the Liberal nomination strategy, but giving the Presidency to another Fascist if possible. If you do something suspicious with your nomination, then it could cast doubt on the player you elect as your President, and the government likely won't go through either. If you are feeling particularly devious, you could try playing on suspicion to cast doubt on a Liberal player by nominating them with little justification.

### Look at top three cards
This power is only available in 5/6 player games, but the version which is present in the rules is not particularly interesting for us. The problem is that if a Liberal looks at the top cards and says that there are Liberal policies at the top, then the Liberals can choose to just Brexit to get free Liberal plays. If a Fascist gets the power and lies, then it’s easy for them to be outed. This can be addressed somewhat by either making the examiner shuffle the three cards before they put them back on top, or (our favourite) barring them from communicating what the cards were before all three have been played or discarded.
