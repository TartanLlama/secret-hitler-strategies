# The Unofficial Secret Hitler Strategy Guide

[Secret Hitler](http://secrethitler.com/) is a social deduction game for 5â€“10 people about finding and stopping the Secret Hitler.

The majority of players are Liberals. If they can learn to trust each other, they have enough votes to control the table and win the game. But some players are Fascists. They will say whatever it takes to get elected, enact their agenda, and blame others for the fallout. The liberals must work together to discover the truth before the fascists install their cold-blooded leader and win the game.

This is an unofficial strategy guide for Secret Hitler. We wrote it to immortalise the insight gained from our group's 400+ games in the form of a living document. We will continue to update this guide as we butcher our metagame and reassemble it into some horrifying meta-Frankenstein's monster.

If you have suggestions for additions or improvements to this guide, please submit an issue or pull request to the repository [here](https://github.com/TartanLlama/secret-hitler-strategies).
